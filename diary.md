Ranting:

Maybe I dont know enough, but writing cross-platform application using C/C++ on Windows is super PAINFUL. Its basically Win32 and everything else.

I dont want to explain the pains. There are too many.

Whatever, to ease your life, you can follow Qt and Gtk's practice, that is using MinGW(MSYS2) to build things (Dont have to install Visual Studio at all).
