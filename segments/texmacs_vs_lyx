TeXmacs

pros:

Better Integration with other softwares -> maxima/gnuplot etc.
Highly customizable in case of functionality -> with scheme
Better keyboard shortcuts (developed by real scientist).
Source code is readable, since most of them are written by scheme.
Better look and feel when editing.
Easier to learn (less functionality and more "strict")

A really good structure text editor => Its how the GOOD world supposed to be!
The idea is really beyond time.

cons:

Still use old Guile1.x and interface is laggy (probably lack of manpower to improve)

Lyx

pros:

Better Latex Export (Don't include any custom macros, i.e. 1 to 1 convert)
Highly customizable in case of styles (easily use custom latex macros) 
Potentially bigger dev group.

cons:

Have to copy things back and forth form external softwares.
1 stable release per 2 years for many years. 

Cons of both:

Both use their very own format (.lyx and .tm)

Conclusion:

when you have to use a CAS or gnuplot => Texmacs
For math only => Texmacs

Lets go Texmacs anyway.

When you may need complex formatting => lyx
